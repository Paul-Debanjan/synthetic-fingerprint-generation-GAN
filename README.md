# Synthetic Fingerprint Generation with GANs

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to **classify and generate synthetic fingerprint images** for both **male and female subjects**, across **10 different fingers** (left/right × 5).  

The project has two main components:
1. **CNN Classifier** – Trains a convolutional neural network to classify fingerprints by finger type.
2. **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** – Generates realistic synthetic fingerprint images conditioned on **finger type** and **gender**.
